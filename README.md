when i was playing Stronghold Crusader i found really annoying that stockpile gets full rather quickly 
it was pretty time consuming to sell all that resources i didn't need 
and then it hit me 
for my next project i'll make something that manages resources on its own 
it's not a mod or anything 
just another project for me that i can practise using visual studio
